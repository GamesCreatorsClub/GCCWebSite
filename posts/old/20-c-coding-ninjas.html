<p>For the Code Ninjas in the club, we took a look at C++ for the first 
time. This is a *massive* new challenge, so don’t feel bad if you found 
it a bit daunting! </p>  <p><a href="../../../images/old/image_thumb_1.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: left; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" alt="image" src="../../../images/old/image_thumb_1.png" border="0" align="left" height="194" width="244"></a>Unlike
 python, C++ is a compiled language, which means we can’t avoid looking 
at how the code that we write is actually converted into the code that 
the computer truly understands. In python this process goes on too, but 
we just don’t see it. In addition, we are expected to understand the 
computer’s underlying structure and resources (in particular its memory)
 and manage these directly for ourselves as we write our program. 
However, in return for this additional complexity C++ is one of the few 
remaining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming_language">‘System Languages’</a>
 still in common use – this means that you could even write an operating
 system (such as Windows itself) using a language like C++. Indeed 
Android, Linux and the like have mostly been written using C (a closely 
related pre-cursor of C++).</p>  <p>Because C++ requires quite a few 
steps to get from our source code (the text we write) to byte code (the 
code the computer actually runs) it makes life a lot easier if use an 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to work in – provided we have a
 compiler and linker though, we could (and probably will at some point, 
just to prove it) do everything we need from simple text editor – even 
notepad!</p>  <p>The IDE we’ve settled on for now is CodeBlocks and this
 includes GCC compiler and linker see the tools and technology section 
for download info.</p>  <p>We will have a lot of conceptual ground work 
to cover over the next few weeks, but I want to have something visual 
for you to tinker with so I skipped over *a lot* of topics and we looked
 at single page of code that made use of two existing libraries – GLFW 
&amp; OpenGL. GLFW allowed us to make a Window and run our simple game 
loop, then OpenGL provides the 3D drawing commands we need to put stuff 
on the screen. The process of incorporating these libraries will be 
covered again. But the important thing I highlighted was that the key 
concepts of the code itself were almost identical to pygame: </p>  <ul>   <li>Initialise the window, </li>    <li>Start a while loop that runs until the window is closed (the game loop) </li>    <li>Within the loop:</li>    <ul>     <li>Collect the messages from Windows (otherwise it thinks we are dead, or at least ‘Not responding’</li>      <li>Draw our graphics.</li>   </ul> </ul>  <p>Simples! <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Winking smile" src="../../../images/old/wlemoticon-winkingsmile_2.png"></p>
