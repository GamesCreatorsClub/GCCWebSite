 Pong has a Minecraft theme, with a great backdrop and rather alarming 
head for a ball! From a coding point of view I really like the fact that
 this is a complete game – it has game state management so that there is
 a proper start screen (with instructions) and a game over screen to 
tell you which player ‘sucked’! Excellent stuff Naeem – your first full 
game published right here.</p>  <p align="right"><font size="4"><a href="http://www.abstracthorizon.org/gcc/games/index.html#games/naeems-pong-game">Play Pong Craft</a></font></p>
