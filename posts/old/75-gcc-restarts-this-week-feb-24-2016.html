 get the second half of this term underway with a bit of game coding! 
I’ll be starting a Python Crash Course (or ‘Refresher’, depending on 
your perspective) for those who are new to the club, preparing for their
 GCSE project, or would just like to brush up on their skills.</p>  <p>For
 everyone else, there is still plenty of interesting stuff to do on 
building your game levels or extending the game engine for 
YumikosAdventure. I’ve noticed a couple of people have branched the 
github repository, so I’m interested to see what you have been up to 
over the half-term break. See you there. E</p>
