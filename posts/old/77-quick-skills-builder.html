<p><img style="float: left; margin: 6px; display: inline" src="../../../images/old/233862525.html" align="left" height="227" width="227">After
 last week’s Python refresher, those of you who would like to 
consolidate the topics we covered can have a crack at this guided 
tutorial:</p>  <p><a title="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-en-4XuFm/0/1" href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-en-4XuFm/0/1">https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-en-4XuFm/0/1</a></p>  <p>We’ll
 be on hand to discuss the interesting bits and at the end you should 
have your first fully functional version of a very simple Battleships 
game – ready for some enhancements and customisation if you finish it 
with time to spare! More importantly though, you should also have the 
set of coding concepts we will put to further use with some graphics and
 pygame next week.</p>
