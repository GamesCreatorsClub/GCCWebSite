			Pygame Graphics</a>

<p>Thanks to the efforts of the IT staff at the school (cheers Manjit 
&amp; Josh, we really appreciate it!) this week’s meeting was the first 
one we’ve run without having to use Raspberry Pi’s for our python 
programming. Not only was this easier to organise, but it was also more 
productive and you all now have access to your own files and projects 
via the school network.</p>  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315155221/http://www.raspberrypilot.com/images/image_2_fe8e0c141e9ea0bde2f10a87e5d64044.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: left; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" alt="image" src="../../../images/old/image_thumb_d0b0338fcaf19ad226f55205df896e10.png" border="0" align="left" height="244" width="234"></a>So
 in this session we had a little refresher on variables, then we cracked
 straight on with creating our own sprite (using Paint.net) and then 
rendered it on the screen using the pygame library.This process uses the
 command ‘Blit’, which is short for a <strong>bl</strong>ock <strong>i</strong>mage <strong>t</strong>ransfer.
 As we will see in later sessions, this is the mainstay for rendering 
nearly all your graphical game elements. Early computers that were aimed
 at running games had a dedicated chip whose sole role was to perform 
these fast copies of image data blocks to the video memory area from 
which the screen display is drawn. On our modern computers using pygame 
the process is still being performed by an entirely independent 
computer-within-the-computer called the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) 
in order to make it lightning fast.</p>  <p><strong><em>Don’t forget that if you have access to a computer at home, you can install python, pygame &amp; Paint.net for free – go to the </em></strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315155221/http://www.raspberrypilot.com/index.php/tools-technology"><strong><em>tools and technology section</em></strong></a><strong><em> for links. You should also be able to log in to the school VLE and be able to access and update your files from home.</em></strong></p>
