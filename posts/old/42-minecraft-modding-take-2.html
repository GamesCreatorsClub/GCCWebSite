 week is the last session of the year! We will be doing more minecraft 
modding using Javascript. We will have a common server running for you 
all to connect to, but please remember to <strong>bring your own laptop with minecraft</strong> on it if you can, but before you do please:</p>  <ul>   <li>Download minecraft 1.6.4</li>    <li>Create a new profile that runs in this version</li>    <li>Disconnect your laptop from the internet and make sure you can still run under this profile</li> </ul>  <p>I
 will be setting up our own GCC wireless network and we will also talk a
 bit more about how computers connect and communicate over local area 
networks (LANs) and the internet.</p>  <p>Instructions are links are all here in <a href="https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/docs/YoungPersonsGuideToProgrammingMinecraft.md">The Young Person’s Guide to Programming in Minecraft</a>. Feel free to get ahead of the game (literally!) before Wednesday…</p>
