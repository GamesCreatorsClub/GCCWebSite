 term we are going to add a touch of class to our python coding. This 
year we have learned how to create, store and retrieve data of different
 types. We have also learned out to manipulate and transform this data 
using functions. Often in our projects we have had to use the global 
keyword to ensure that our functions are all operating on the same items
 of data (not just creating a copy of the data which is only used within
 the function). Wouldn’t it be useful if the data and functions for a 
particular entity (or object) in your game could be kept together, 
without having to pass the data, in a global form, explicitly between 
each function call? It would also be great if you need lots of these 
entities, the functions would ‘know’ which object instance they were 
acting on?</p>  <p>For example, we want lots of aliens in our game. Each
 alien will move using the same logic and be destroyed in a similar way 
by our missiles, but each will have its own position and perhaps its own
 sprite image? In other words, we want to reuse the same functions, but 
on different data for each alien object instance.</p>  <p>The final data
 structure we want to tackle this year capable of achieving this, and 
other very useful features and it is called a Class. To introduce 
classes we are going to work through the following exercise:</p>  <p><a title="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-intermediate-en-WL8e4/0/1" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315220715/https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-intermediate-en-WL8e4/0/1">https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-intermediate-en-WL8e4/0/1</a></p>
