<p><img style="float: left; margin: 6px; display: inline" src="../../../images/old/wolfenstein.gif" align="left" height="178" width="254">As
 usual we’ll avoid a session during the hectic first week back, so 
*don’t* come along this Wednesday (4th June), our first club session 
will be next week – <strong>Wednesday 11th June</strong>. Lots to see and discuss then.</p>  <p>This
 term we will take a look at some alternative input methods – in 
particular the mouse – so that we can add some option and title pages 
with clickable buttons and settings.</p>  <p>We’ll also look at some 
more sophisticated sprite animations and sprite sheets. All good stuff 
and it should all contribute to making your current game projects even 
slicker.</p>  <p>Oh, and I have an updated SDK for the Oculus Rift, so 
towards the end of term will have another play with immersive virtual 
reality…</p>
