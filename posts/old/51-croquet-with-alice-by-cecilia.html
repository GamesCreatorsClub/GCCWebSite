 needs your help to knock the hedgehogs through the hoops in as few a 
goes as possible. Use the mouse to move Alice behind the hedgehog and 
click the left button to give it some <em>‘mallet-based encouragement</em>’
 to move in the direction you want!. Don’t worry though, only a few real
 hedgehogs and no real mallets were harmed in the making of this game <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Winking smile" src="../../../images/old/Games%212_files/wlemoticon-winkingsmile_2_3afc06e28a2681d3a2b56b0e4f66e479.html"></p>  <p><font size="4"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316005933/http://www.abstracthorizon.org/gcc/games/index.html#games/cecilia-croquet-with-alice">Start Hedgehog Croquet</a></font></p>
