 impressive keyboard cunning and code cleverness, Daniel has converted a
 number of our python games so that they can run in a standard web 
browser (such as IE or Chrome). Check out our new Games section from the
 menu on the left to see the ones we’ve done so far. First Daniel ported
 the python code to java and then, using a graphics library called 
LibGDX, he was able to serve up our games inside a normal web browser 
window! I’m sure he will explain and demonstrate the process at a future
 club session, but for now just sit back and try out a few of your own 
games published for the first time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315233533/http://www.raspberrypilot.com/index.php/games">right here on our own website</a>!</p>
