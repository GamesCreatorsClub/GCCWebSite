 organised by Richard Barfoot, Head of Computing. The Kenilworth School 
stand was focused on computer-based ‘making’. With a 3D Printer, an ‘<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315233533/http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/tinykitlist/171-egg-bot">Egg-bot’</a>,
 a home-built computer-controlled drawing machine and a commercial 
milling machine on display, we were able to show lots of ways that 
Computer Numerical Control (CNC) can assist you in realising your 
designs and inventions. </p>  <p>Emily (Year 8) decorated a dozen eggs over the course of the fair using computer drawings created in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315233533/http://www.inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a> – a free, open-source, vector drawing package. The designs were converted into motor movements by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315233533/http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/tinykitlist/171-egg-bot">Egg-bot</a> so that it could draw them on the surface of an egg using a fine marker pen.</p>  <p>Lewis (Year 7) ran a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315233533/http://www.shapeoko.com/">Shapeoko</a> CNC machine, built from a kit and controlled using an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315233533/http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardDue">Arduino</a> open-source computer, which also had a Lego pen-hol<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315233533/http://www.raspberrypilot.com/images/wp_000690_2.jpg"><img title="WP_000690" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: right; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 6px 0px 6px 6px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" alt="WP_000690" src="../../../images/old/wp_000690_thumb.html" border="0" align="right" height="184" width="244"></a>der.
 Visitors to our stand were able to select a design using a touch screen
 and have the computer draw it for them. Sam, aged 8, came back several 
times in order to see *all* pictures on offer but his particular 
favourite was Lego Batman.</p>  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315233533/http://www.raspberrypilot.com/images/wp_000684_2.jpg"><img title="WP_000684" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: left; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 6px 6px 6px 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" alt="WP_000684" src="../../../images/old/wp_000684_thumb.html" border="0" align="left" height="184" width="244"></a>The
 fair was packed with lots of great stands with plenty to do. Near to 
us, Paul Foster from Microsoft ran workshops for the kids to construct 
their own digital camera using components from their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315233533/http://www.netmf.com/gadgeteer/">Gadgeteer</a> range. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315233533/http://www.retrocomputermuseum.co.uk/">Retro Computer Museum</a>
 team put on an awesome display of computer games history for us all to 
play – the young and not-so-young alike! The students of KES showed an 
impressive array of their own computer games and robot projects. Plus *a
 lot* more besides…</p>  <p>Thanks for inviting us Richard, and I’m already looking forward to next year!</p>
