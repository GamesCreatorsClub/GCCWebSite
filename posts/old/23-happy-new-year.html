 to 2014. I hope everyone had a great Christmas break and spent their 
time coding on exciting new gadgets? Santa brought me an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316010019/http://www.oculusvr.com/">Oculus Rift Virtual Reality Headset</a>,
 which is extremely cool. The dev kit has kept me fully occupied over 
the holidays and Iâ€™ll perhaps demo it at one of our meetings soon.</p>  <p>Our first session for 2014 will be on:</p>  <p><strong><font size="4">Wednesday 14 January</font></strong> at the usual time of <strong><font size="4">6:30pm.</font></strong></p>  <p>We have lots of interesting projects for the new term, so we're looking forward to seeing you all then.</p>
