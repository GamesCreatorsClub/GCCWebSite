We will be kicking off the first session of GCC tomorrow evening (<strong>Wednesday 14 September, 19:00-20:00</strong>) but *please note* we will be in <strong><u>L27</u></strong> this year (where we had the last couple of session of last year).</p>  <p>We
 have some cool new stuff to get into this year. As well as extending 
you python skills, we should have access to Unity 3D game development 
using the new computer suite. I’ve also entered us into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026121855/http://piwars.org/">PiWars</a>
 competition early next year (1 April, 2017 in Cambridge). This will 
involves us designing, building and programming an autonomous robot to 
compete in various challenges. Plenty of interesting stuff for everyone!
 See you there…</p>
