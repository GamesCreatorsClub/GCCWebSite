I’ve had very positive feedback from the organisers <a href="../../../images/old/3_thumb.jpg"><img title="3" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: right; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" alt="3" src="../../../images/old/3_thumb.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="184" width="244"></a>and I think that we can be really pleased with the interest we generated both from the students and the teachers who attended.</p>  <p>We
 had several Raspberry Pi’s on the go showing python scripting for 
Minecraft. We were also running a slick professional game compiled from 
source C++ code on the RPi’s. We can’t really claim any GCC credit here,
 but playing Quake 3 at full frame-rate on a pocket PC was cool and does
 show off what our little club computers are capable of when suitably 
motivated!</p>  <p>I think we also need a particular mention for Tim for
 his RPi phone controlled disco setup – a really ingenious effort and 
all his own work. A genuinely impressive combination of electronics, 
internet comms and PHP – well done Tim!</p>  <p><a href="../../../images/old/2_thumb.jpg"><img title="2" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: left; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 6px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" alt="2" src="../../../images/old/2_thumb.jpg" border="0" align="left" height="184" width="244"></a>Tim’s
 fully functioning project put my (notably unfunctional) homebrew CNC 
machine to shame, but I have been working on it since the show, so watch
 this space…</p>  <p>Luckily we also had a Cubify 3D Printer beavering 
away to build a plastic Raspberry Pi case from a 3D computer model. A 
power cut at a rather critical moment meant we had to start the build 
process again from the beginning but people didn’t seem to mind. 
Watching the machine creating a real object, apparently from thin air, 
was mesmerising.</p>
