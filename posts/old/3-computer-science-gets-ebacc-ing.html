 Gove (the Education Secretary) has announced that Computer Science will
 join the ‘core’ subjects that will contribute to the new English 
Baccalaureate (EBacc). Braodly speaking this places Computer Science on a
 par with Physics, Biology and Chemistry and follows a continuing 
response of the government to redress the loss of *real* computing 
skills that have been eroded by a general confusion with IT literacy.In a
 speech last November Gove said:</p>
<p><em>Imagine the dramatic change which could be possible in just a few
 years... Instead of children bored out of their minds being taught how 
to use Word and Excel by bored teachers, we could have 11-year-olds able
 to write simple 2D computer animations using an MIT tool called 
Scratch. By 16, they could have an understanding of formal logic 
previously covered only in University courses and be writing their own 
Apps for smartphones.</em></p>
<p>This is precisely what we hope to achieve at GCC!</p>
