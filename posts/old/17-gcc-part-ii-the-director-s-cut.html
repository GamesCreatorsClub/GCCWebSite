However, we are also going to <strong>*double*</strong>
 the duration of each session. For all-comers in the first hour we’ll be
 working on Minecraft mods using Python then, in the second hour, we be 
able to focus entirely on more advanced coding topics for Year 9’s and 
up using Unity 3D. Please watch out for posters in the school and check 
with your tutors for a full update this week. </p>
