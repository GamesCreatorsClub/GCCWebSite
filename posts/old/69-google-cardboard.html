<p><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Last
 week Andrew brought in a very cheap solution to virtual reality 
hardware. &nbsp;This was the Google Cardboard, which was introduced to 
Android developers in 2014. &nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard" style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard</a><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;"> &nbsp;A new version (Cardboard 2) has been released in 2015 which is slighly larger and has a different input method.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">It 
is simply a large piece of shaped cardboard, a couple of 45 mm focal 
length lenses, some velcro, a couple of magnets and a mobile phone with 
some software. &nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/" style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">If 
you can get the lenses, you can build one yourself really easily; but to
 buy one from Amazon costs in the region of Â£6 - so just buy it. &nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cardboard-Virtual-Reality-Glasses-Headband/dp/B00V7Z2XM0" style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cardboard-Virtual-Reality-Glasses-Headband/dp/B00V7Z2XM0</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">More
 excitingly for GCC is that you can download a 'unitypackage' for unity 
and create your own virtual worlds which you can experience on your 
Google Cardboard. &nbsp;</span><a href="https://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/" style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;"><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 15.8079996109009px;">https://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">Finally,
 although this works on iOS and Android, only Android allows you to put 
the resulting program on the Android phone for free. &nbsp;<a href="http://developer.android.com/develop/index.html">http://developer.android.com/develop/index.html</a>
 &nbsp;Until XCode 7 and iOS9 is released, you will need to pay Apple 
for a developer account to put your program on an iPhone. &nbsp; <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">https://developer.apple.com/programs/</a></span></p>
