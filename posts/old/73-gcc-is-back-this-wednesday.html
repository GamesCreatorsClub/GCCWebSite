<p><img src="../../../images/old/family.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 6px; display: inline;" border="0" align="left" height="171" width="322">Everything is up an running with shiny new versions of Python, pygame and our other game dev tools. Make sure you join us for <span style="font-size: large;">7-8pm in L24</span>.
 We’ll start the term off with a bit of retro-gaming on the RPi’s for a 
bit of fun and inspiration. Nick is working hard on a brand new game 
framework for us to work through and we’ll also be making extensive use 
of Codeacademy this term to hone our python and javascript game coding 
skills.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to bring along your own laptops and Pi’s if you want, 
and we’re looking forward to seeing what projects you’ve been up to over
 the break. See you there! E</p>
