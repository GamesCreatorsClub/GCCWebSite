 restarts this week – Wednesday 25th February. Usual time, Usual place. I
 hope you had a good break but managed to cram in plenty of coding. This
 week we’ll be continuing to work on our asteroids game. Plus my 
Raspberry Pi 2 finally arrived, so we can give it a test drive!</p>  <p>See you all there.</p>  <p>E</p>
