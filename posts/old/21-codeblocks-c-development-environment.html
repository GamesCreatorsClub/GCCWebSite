 we can run our C++ source code we must first compile it into code that 
our computer can understand. Typically, as we develop our project, we 
will break it down into smaller manageable sets of useful functions and 
tools that we compile separated. In addition, we will frequently want to
 use the compiled code that other people have written in our own 
projects. In both these cases we need an additional step after compiling
 to ‘link’ all these bits together. Compiling and Linking are the two 
main components in a tool chain that we <img style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline" src="../../../images/old/20100602191212Cb_splash.png" align="left" height="139" width="282">need
 to manage when we build a C++ application. To make our lives simpler we
 can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that combines the 
text editor we need to actually write our source code, with a nice 
interface to manage all the files we want to compile and link to form 
our final application.</p>  <p>CodeBlocks is a free IDE that is 
cross-platform (available on Windows, Mac, Linux – including my beloved 
Raspberry Pi) and focused on C++ development (unlike Eclipse). Some 
aspects are little raw compared to Microsoft’s Visual Studio, for 
example, but we are meant to be learning about the process to some 
extent any way. <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Winking smile" src="../../../images/old/wlemoticon-winkingsmile_2_7d54f624824a99d7b544d86f70fcc460.png"></p>  <h1>Downloads</h1>  <p>You can download the main program for each of the main platforms <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026123253/http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26">here</a>.</p>
