<p>Paint.net is free image editor that runs on Windows PC’s. I’ve chosen
 it for us to use for creating our 2D art assets because, while being 
relatively easily learn, it has many of the features and concepts that 
you may come across in professional, industry-standard, graphics 
packages later in your careers. Currently the big one is Adobe’s 
Photoshop and Paint.net is very similar to it in many respects, but 
without costing about £350 a go! In particular it allows us to use image
 layers, combine modes and alpha blended transparency. </p>  <p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline" src="../../../images/old/pdn35_kirkland_thumb.jpg" align="left" height="203" width="306"></p>  <p>If you have access to a Windows PC or laptop at home you can download your own copy of <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html">Paint,net from here</a>.</p>  <p>Although
 it is free, if you really like it (as I do) then please consider 
donating a tenner to my fellow software developers for their sterling 
efforts <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/donate.html">here</a>. <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="../../../images/old/wlemoticon-smile_2.png"></p>
