<p><img src="../../../images/old/logo.png" border="0">The Games Creators 
Club will have a stand at this year’s Big Bang science and engineering 
fair at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry on 25 June. We will be part of the 
Imagineering area and we will be showing off our latest game designs, 
Raspberry Pi contraptions and discussing all things computery with 
whoever is interested! All of year 8 from Kenilworth school will be in 
attendance, plus hundreds of other students from across the region. 
Should be great, but we’d better get our games finished in time...!</p>
