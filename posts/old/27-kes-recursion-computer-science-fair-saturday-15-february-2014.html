<p>I’ll be there to represent GCC &amp; Kenilworth School and I’ll 
hopefully have lots of interesting things to show, including my usual 
Raspberry Pi goodness, a CNC-machine, a 3D printer and lots of homebrew 
games! Also at the fair will be robot wars, electronics projects, 
hands-on activities and lots more.</p>
<p>The fair will be open between 11.00 – 16:00, and all are welcome.</p>
<p>More details can be found on the website: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316010019/http://www.recursioncomputerfair.co.uk/" title="http://www.recursioncomputerfair.co.uk/">http://www.recursioncomputerfair.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Hopefully see as many of you there as possible!</p>
