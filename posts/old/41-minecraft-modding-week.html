 is going to start teaching basic minecraft modding this week (2nd 
July). Once again the school computers can’t be used for this so <strong><em>if you have your own laptop, please bring it along – especially if you already have Minecraft installed</em></strong>.
 We’ll bring all the additional installation files you will need. If you
 don’t have your own laptop then don’t worry – I will bring a couple of 
extra laptops for you to use.</p>
