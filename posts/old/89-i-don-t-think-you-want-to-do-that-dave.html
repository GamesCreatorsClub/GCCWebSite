<p><img style="float: left; margin: 6px; display: inline" src="../../../images/old/2000px-HAL9000.png" align="left" height="122" width="122">In
 this session we are going to begin thinking about AI by adding a 
computer opponent to our number guessing game. Along the way we are 
going to introduce two new important concepts – logical combinations 
when making decisions and extending the available commands by adding a 
function.</p>  <p>The new version of the game is going to introduce a 
competitive element to the game by having the computer guess the code 
number each time the player does. Instead of the simple ‘higher’ ‘lower’
 feedback we provided we will instead indicate who is closer to the 
answer each round. This is adds two elements to our game – a competitive
 tension and a clue that allows the player to improve there skill at the
 game with practice. We’ll discuss what makes a ‘good’ game many times 
over the coming sessions I am sure!</p>  <h2>Functions</h2>  <p>So far 
we have coded using commands, or functions, that already form part of 
the Python language and libraries. A function is a self-contained mini 
program that completes a calculation or task in its own right. They are 
very important for structuring more complicated programs and allowing 
you to re-use your code effectively. Functions often receive the data on
 which they will operate in the form of an ‘argument list’, which is 
passed to the function inside a pair of brackets () that follow the 
function name. A good example of a function is print() where you would 
normally pass the string of text you want to print as an argument 
(inside quotes and between the brackets) and the print function just 
does its thing without you having to worry about the ‘mini-program’ 
inside.</p>  <p>Our function is going to compare two values and return 
the absolute difference between them for us to use to give a clue back 
to the player as to their next guess. At the top of our program we start
 by defining the function we are going to use as follows:</p>  <pre><font color="#0000ff">def</font> difference(x, y):<br>    <font color="#0000ff">if</font> x &gt;= y:<br>        result = x - y<br>    <font color="#0000ff">else</font>:<br>        result = y - x<br>    <font color="#0000ff">return</font> result</pre>

<p>As you can see we start with the Def keyword, our function’s name and
 the arguments it is going to use. The rest of the code is just a 
mini-program that does its stuff and returns the answer.</p>

<p>Once defined, we can use our function just like any pre-existing one –
 we’ve effectively *extended* the language, how cool is that?</p>

<h2>I’m never going to not do the opposite…</h2>

<p>The other new concept to introduce logical combinations in our 
decisions. In our new game design, we need to check if either the player
 *or* the computer has one.’Or’ is the first of several ways of 
combining questions to make a decision the other really important one is
 ‘and’. If you check to see if one thing is true ‘or’ another thing is 
true – then the decision will be triggered if either one is true. If we 
only want to trigger the decision if both things are true we can use 
‘and’ instead.</p>

<p>Here is the code in its entirety, see if you can locate all the logical decisions being made and follow the flow of the program:</p>

<pre>import random</pre>

<pre><br><br><font color="#0000ff">def</font> difference(x, y):<br>    <font color="#0000ff">if</font> x &gt;= y:<br>        result = x - y<br>    <font color="#0000ff">else</font>:<br>        result = y - x<br>    <font color="#0000ff">return</font> result</pre>

<pre><br><br>answer = random.randint(<font color="#4f81bd">1, 100</font>)<br><br><font color="#0000ff">print</font>(<font color="#4bacc6">'I have selected a number between 1 and 100.'</font>)</pre>

<pre><br><br><em><font color="#008000"># Main game loop, only exits when there is a winner using 'break'</font></em><br>while True:</pre>

<pre><br>    <em><font color="#008000"># Lets get the player and computer guesses<br></font></em>    player_guess = int(input(<font color="#4bacc6">'Your guess? '</font>))<br>    computer_guess = random.randint(1,100)<br>    <font color="#0000ff">print</font>(<font color="#4bacc6">'Computer guess is: '</font> + str(computer_guess))</pre>

<pre><br><br>    <em><font color="#008000"># Has either one won?</font></em><br>    if computer_guess == answer or player_guess == answer:<br>        <font color="#0000ff">break</font></pre>

<pre><br><br>    <em><font color="#008000"># See who is closest?</font></em><br>    player_guess_difference = difference(answer, player_guess)<br>    computer_guess_difference = difference(answer, computer_guess)</pre>

<pre><br><br>    <em><font color="#008000"># Print a clue</font></em><br>    <font color="#0000ff">if</font> player_guess_difference &gt; computer_guess_difference:<br>        <font color="#0000ff">print</font>(<font color="#4bacc6">'The Computer is closer...'</font>)<br>    <font color="#0000ff">elif</font> player_guess_difference == computer_guess_difference:<br>        <font color="#0000ff">print</font>(<font color="#4bacc6">'You are both neck and neck'</font>)<br>    <font color="#0000ff">else</font>:<br>        <font color="#0000ff">print</font>(<font color="#4bacc6">'You are closer. Nearly there...'</font>)</pre>

<pre><br><br><em><font color="#008000"># We get here once we break from the loop, but who has won?</font><br></em><font color="#0000ff">if</font> computer_guess == answer:<br>    <font color="#0000ff">print</font>(<font color="#4bacc6">'You LOSE. Sorry, it seems your computer is smarter than you.'</font>)<br><font color="#0000ff">else</font>:<br>    <font color="#0000ff">print</font>(<font color="#4bacc6">'You WIN. Phew, you are still the boss!'</font>)</pre>
