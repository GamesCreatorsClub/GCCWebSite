 been all change in the computer lab over the summer, so we can look 
forward to a big update to the computers we use at the club. We’re still
 waiting to hear when this work will be complete and our games tools 
will be ready to roll again, so unfortunately there <strong>won’t </strong>be a club session this week (<em>no session on Wednesday 16 September</em>). But watch this space and we’ll have things underway as soon as we can. Lots of new, fun&nbsp; and interesting stuff ahead…</p>
