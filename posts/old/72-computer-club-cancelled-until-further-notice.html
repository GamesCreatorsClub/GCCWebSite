<p><img style="float: left; margin: 6px; display: inline" src="../../../images/old/Frustration-Small.jpg" align="left" height="154" width="230">I’m
 afraid that the changes to the school computer lab are still precluding
 us from restarting the computer club. It seems that all of the club’s 
tools and code samples were removed by the school over the summer and we
 have been unable to get them reinstated so far – without basic coding 
tools we obviously cannot teach coding. </p>  <p>We *hope* that we might
 be allowed to restart in the next half of the term but as I’m sure you 
can appreciate it is quite a commitment for the helpers (and your 
parents!) and after four cancellations in a row I think we are better to
 write-off this half-term now. I am, of course, very sorry. </p>  <p>If 
you are still coding in your spare time (I hope you are) then do drop me
 a line at my raspberrypilot.com email address at any time with any 
computing questions you may have and we can still try and help out with 
your code and projects.</p>  <p>Hopefully see you after the half-term break.</p>  <p>E</p>
