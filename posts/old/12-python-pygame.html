<p><img style="display: inline; float: left" alt="homepage" src="../../../images/old/python-logo.gif" align="left"></p>  <p>We
 base our programming around python &amp; pygame at the club. Python is 
good language for learning general and transferrable programming 
principles, as well as a useful skill in itself. Many commercial and 
professional products use python, often as a scripting interface to the 
main application (see our minecraft meeting write-up for an example). 
Pygame is set of extensions to the core python language, specifically 
for creating graphics and games. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.pygame.org"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" alt="image" src="../../../images/old/image_thumb_8088782701a28dd2738700333e630aaf.png" border="0" align="right" height="68" width="240"></a></p>  <p>A
 key benefit of using these technologies is that they are both 
available, free of charge, on Windows, Mac and Linux (including the 
Rasperry Pi) so everyone can try out what theyâ€™ve learned on a variety 
of other computers in between the club meetings. There is even a version
 being developed that will run on Android phones and tablets.</p>  <h2>Downloads</h2>  <p>Python: <a title="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/" href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/">http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/</a></p>  <p>(<strong>Note:</strong> We use python 2.7.3, because python 3+ is still not fully supported by pygame)</p>  <p>Pygame: <a title="http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml" href="http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml">http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml</a></p>
