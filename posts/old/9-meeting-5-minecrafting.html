<p>For the last 10 minutes of the session I found a great target for our
 new-found python skills in a proper commercial game – Minecraft.</p>
<p>The version recently released for the RPi can be found at the PiStore
 and it includes a python scripting interface. I moved the mcpi 
directory onto the desktop of the club RPi’s for easy access.</p>
<h2>Initialising our connection to minecraft</h2>
<p>First we need start minecraft running in X Windows on the Pi, then 
open a terminal window in the mcpi directory and change our current 
directory (using the cd command) to the one containing the python module
 for minecraft:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: medium;">cd mcpi/api/python/acpi</span></p>
<p>then start python</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: medium;">python</span></p>
<p>and import the minecraft module into a namespace called ‘minecraft’.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: medium;">import minecraft as minecraft</span></p>
<p>and get hold of the main minecraft object:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: medium;">mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create()</span></p>
<p>Now we should have a minecraft object called ‘mc’ and we can use it 
to access lots of different commands in minecraft. We can find out where
 we are with:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: medium;">mc.Player.getTilePos()</span></p>
<p>then create some blocks around us using:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: medium;">mc.setBlock(x, y, z, block_id)</span></p>
<p>where the block_id is one of the many types of block. It turns out 
that Scott has an encyclopaedic knowledge of these and told me that id 
‘10’ is lava. This was impressive, but caused me to die from my own lava
 flow almost immediately in my own demo <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile" src="../../../images/old/wlemoticon-sadsmile_2.png" alt="Sad smile" style="border-style: none;" border="0"></p>

<p>You can use all the usual python constructs, like for loops, to 
programmatically creating lots of shapes. You can even create python 
module with some functions defined to create whole structures or 
buildings automatically. Enjoy!</p>
